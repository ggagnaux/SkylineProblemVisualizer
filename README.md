# Skyline Problem Visualizer
An application that will help visualize data for the skyline algorithm problem.

This application was inspired by an problem assignment from a past algorithm course. 

## Description from course material
>With the advent of high speed graphics workstations, CAD (computer-aided design) and other areas (CAM, VLSI design) have made increasingly eﬀective use of computers. One of the problems with drawing images is the elimination of hidden lines obscured by other parts of a drawing. Design a program to assist an architect in drawing the skyline of a city given the locations of the buildings in the city. To make the problem tractable, all buildings are rectangular in shape and they share a common bottom (the city they are built in is very ﬂat). The city is also viewed as two- dimensional. A building is speciﬁed by an ordered triple (Li,Hi,Ri) where Li and Ri are left and right coordinates, respectively, of building i and Hi is the height of the building. 

>In the diagram below buildings are shown on the left with triples 

>(1,11,5),(2,6,7),(3,13,9),(12,7,16),(14,3,25),(19,18,22),(23,13,29),(24,4,28) 
>the skyline, shown on the right, is represented by the sequence: 

>(1,11,3,13,9,0,12,7,16,3,19,18,22,3,23,13,29,0)

After writing a console-only application to process the skyline data, I thought it would be cool to write an actual visualizer.  
This is a work in progress so one may encounter issues.



## TODO/Issues
* Implement Unit Testing
* Resolve some outstanding bugs
* Fix implementation of rendering data points on chart area
